# TODOs


- ~~Remove use of ES6 class definitions (keep all ES5 for now)~~
- ~~Re-engineer the API to be more consistent between different transports (e.g. calls are
made the same way not matter whether using UDP, TCP or TLS with same API)~~
- ~~Remove emitting API (or perhaps extend it) of the objects~~
- ~~Coding style~~
- ~~Constant strings for values in RFC (needs tests)~~
[RFCs](https://sematext.com/blog/what-is-syslog-daemons-message-formats-and-protocols/) (RFC3164 and RFC5424)
- ~~Update README.md with latest features and usage examples~~
- Re-engineer the parser to be tolerant of both
